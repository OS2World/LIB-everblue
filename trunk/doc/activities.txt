
Architecture
------------
- review interprocess communication
- eliminate import in xdaemon\lib\xdaemon.def
        _XUnlockDisplay     = X11.XUnlockDisplay
     not good practise, only good for now
     move lock code partly to xdeamon
- eliminate unwanted redraws from hook queue on windows resizing


Project documentation
---------------------
- Module overview
- IPC overview
- Build prerequisites
- determine sources of imported X11 sources
  - define URLs
  - modification for xlibint.h
    - X11\xlibint.h and x11.h in x11\include\x11\ (patched original)
    - extend C_INCLUDE_PATH by x11\include
  - region.h -> <X11/Xregion.h> ???
  - xcms and xmisc: xlib.h replaced by version from x11 header
- existing licenses used by imported source, licences used by own sources
- def settings
  - ebhook/xdaemon def settings
    LIBRARY EBHOOK INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE: done by _DLL_InitTerm for all instances
    SINGLE SHARED: InitTerm.c: HMTX global_lock
  - x11 MULTIPLE NONSHARED
- makefile of ebhook
  - -Zno-fork required for -nodefaultlibs

Coding
------
- create syslog concept, add syslog calls to libraries
- syslog calls in hook dll (req. runtime ?)
- review header files
  - Layout
  - ifdef encapsulation
- finish drawing methods & text handling
- include & extend everblue1 code (mouse cursors, m&k grabbing etc)
   - mouse cursors
   - mouse/keyboard grabbing
   - window sizing
   - window attributes
   - events
- Code review (locking, resource cleanup, bugfixing, code cleanup)
   - resolve  HMTX *_Xglobal_lock = &global_lock; ? EbQueryHookLockSem
      lib\x11\XlibInt.c
   - eliminate global_lock in
      xdaemon\lib\InitTerm.c
      xdaemon\lib\register.c
   - move global_lock from ebhook.c to access.c
- GC attribute handling (Cairo ?, temporary bitmaps ?)


Buildsystem/Build tools
-----------------------
- make clean - kill subdirs
- eliminate myxlibint.h and xlibint.h stubs from X11 directory (see project docs)
- move EBdebug.h  to X11
- eliminate weak prelinker msgs
- generate def files for x11.dll, x11.lib and x11emx.lib by REXX Script
  - source is textfile holding names and ordinal
- remove stacksize from *.def to use  gcc default of 1 MB
- implement call of debugger
- maintain BLDLEVEL in all shipped executables
- modify subdirtree
  current:
     x11
       xcms
       xlibi18n
       Xmisc
  new:
     x11
       include\x11\xlibint.h
       Xfree (renamed from xmisc, + 3 header from lib\x11 dir, ImUtil.h, xatomtype.h, xrmi.h)         
         xcms
         xlibi18n

- extend makefile of x11 to build sub libs
- disable debug for xfree sub libraries, not required
- add code to check for prerequisites



legal issues / licenses
-----------------------
- ensure proper licensing for own/x11 code
- different license for header files ?

what is meant by this ?
--------------------
- standard.c for executables:
  initterm, register.c for xdeamon.dll
- resources req. in xdeamon ?


decisions
---------
- gnu make  3.76.1 required
- remove stacksize from *.def to use  gcc default of 1 MB
- symbol underscore mapping with twodef files required for compatibility with EMX linked apps
  (no workaround possible), one def file is generated by REXX Script
- don't link ebhook with c runtime (makes hook and PM instable)
- header of xfree45 (req. for compilation of x11 apps)
  - store version of header package compatible to spec. relase of everblue on netlabs.org
  - document installation
  - refer to by env var


- InputOnly windows

later!
------
- window manager hints, properties, clipboard
- XKB (keyboard extension)
- Xim - Input Methods -  for foreign languages (chinese etc, use OS/2 methods or X code ?)
- InputOnly (invisible windows catching input)
- other X extensions (XRender, XTest, ...)
- resource exchange after program exit
- Window Save Sets (han dover windows from dying to new window manager)
- WPS-Integration
- window backgrounds
